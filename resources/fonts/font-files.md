# FONT FILES

This repo does not rehost the font files but how to get them is given. All files are downloaded from https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts and the font specifications are given below. Each one uses a prefix of `/resources/fonts` which can be seen in the `.scss` file.

* JetBrains Mono 300
* Montserrat 200, 400 (regular)
